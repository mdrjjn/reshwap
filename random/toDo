Suggestions:
*Add "Other" as a category for books
*Add more info into the manual page.
*Edit the workflow!

Future Plan:
  -- W0rk on adding new features.
  -- Migrate to an independent server
    --BUT in the very long run look for the option to a parse-like style so that in case of lack of
      developers people can still use it long-term.
  -- Expand to more schools. (Can it be done before the server has been migrated)
